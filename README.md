# GIS with R, Python, and other Web Mapping Tools

### Overview
This repository will contain examples on using R, Python, and other open-source tools to complete common spatial operations using code, scripts, and APIs. My experience in the past has primarily been with ESRI ArcGIS with some ArcPy but access to ESRI software professionally is a large financial burden for most organizations. I've found that both R and Python can complete nearly all of the same tasks that ESRI software can for substantially less money with some research and experience with progamming. In many cases, R/Python can perform tasks ESRI software cannot on its own and can be used to extend ESRI or QGIS software with new functionality. I've found individual R and Python resources to be limited in scope whereas my work typically involves niche cases that require researching multiple web resources to figure out. My GIS experience includes work with military/defense intelligence, environment, natural resource management, energy, property data, and public health. This list will be updated over time with R and Python examples that cover most of my previous frustrations.
