# GIS with R, Python, and other Web Mapping Tools

### Overview
This repository will contain examples on using R, Python, and other open-source tools to complete common and niche spatial operations using code, scripts, and APIs. My past professional experience primarily used ESRI ArcGIS with some ArcPy but access to ESRI software is a large financial burden that is difficult to justify for most organizations. I've found that both R and Python can complete nearly all of the same tasks that ESRI software can for substantially less money with some research and experience with progamming. In many cases, R/Python can perform tasks ESRI software cannot on its own and can be used to extend ArcGIS apps or QGIS software with new functionality. I've found several individual R and Python resources to be extensive yet limited in scope whereas my work typically involves niche cases that aren't typically found in books. I'll be adding material over time here with R and Python examples that cover most of my previous frustrations.
